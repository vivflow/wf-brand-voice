# Webflow Inclusive Language Reference
Words carry meaning and can cause harm, even when unintentional. Use this as a reference to avoid unintentional harm.
**General tips:**
- Most inclusivity improvements come from being more specific (e.g., "That's unheard of" instead of "That's crazy")
- Capitalize **Black**, **Native**, and **Indigenous** when referring to people
- Default to gender-neutral pronouns (they/them/their) when you can't confirm someone's pronouns

## Accessibility Writing Practices
- Use clear, plain language — essential for screen reader users and those with reading difficulties
- Don't write "image of X" or "button" — screen readers handle that
- Don't describe things by sensory characteristics ("blue button," "link on the left")
- **Identity-first vs. person-first**: Webflow defaults to identity-first ("disabled person") unless the individual prefers otherwise
- **Alt text**: 60–140 characters, descriptive and concise ("A small brown dog running through a field" not "Image of dog")
- **Link/button text**: Never "click here." Aim for text that makes sense out of context. ✅ "Read our blog post on SEO best practices" ❌ "Click here to learn more"
