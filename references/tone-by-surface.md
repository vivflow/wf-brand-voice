# Webflow Tone by Surface
Audience + Context + Content = Tone. The voice stays constant; the tone shifts.
---
## Web (Marketing Site)
**Dial up**: Knowledgeable — this is home turf, demonstrate expertise
**Balance with**: Clear, outcomes-focused, mindful of reader's time (down-to-earth), cheering users on (empowering)
**Bold**: Sparingly — great customer stats, eye-catching headlines
Avoid sounding "too corporate" (cold, robotic, company-focused, jargon-heavy) or "too casual" (overly familiar, wordy, imprecise). Quick tests:
- Use contractions ("you're" not "you are")
- Read it aloud — edit what you stumble on
- Cut words that are there to impress, not inform
- Get to the point fast, especially on features
---
## Social
**Dial up**: Down-to-earth — most casual, frequent interaction with the community
**Also**: Slightly more bold than other surfaces (make people stop mid-scroll)
**Still**: Knowledgeable and empowering — we're always a thought leader, never just a meme account
**Humor guidelines:**
- Keep it PG
- Keep it positive (no punching down, no harsh self-deprecation)
- Keep it proportional — jokes don't replace substance
- Don't force it — humor belongs only where it feels natural
- Gut check: "If my manager said this to me, would I still respect them?"

## Advertising
**Dial up**: Bold + Empowering — make an impression
**Keep**: Knowledgeable (speak the audience's language) and Down-to-earth (inclusive, warm)
---
## Content (Blog, Ebooks, Whitepapers)
**Lead with**: Knowledge — deep expertise in design, development, marketing
**Tone**: Down-to-earth — not dense, verbose, or inaccessible
**Be**: Thoughtfully bold — hook with a fresh perspective, not clickbait
---
## Education & Community (Webflow University, Forums)
**Shine**: Knowledgeable, empowering, down-to-earth
**Mission**: Guide through every step with warmth and clarity
**Humor**: Use strategically to soften complexity or help something stick
---
## Support
**Feel**: Warm, helpful, human
**Emoji**: OK here — use for positive moments (e.g., "I'm glad that helped! 🎉")
**Tone**: Empathetic, solution-focused, never robotic
---
## Notes on Jargon
- **Buzzwords**: Never. They're off-putting and come across as know-it-all.
- **Technical terms**: Context-dependent. One person's jargon is another's professional vocabulary. Know your audience and meet them there.
- **General rule**: If a term is precise and your audience knows it, use it. If it's vague or imprecise, cut it.
