# Webflow Brand Voice Skill
Use this skill to write, edit, or review any content on behalf of Webflow — from marketing copy to support messages to social posts.
## Brand Personality: The Wise Mentor
Webflow's brand personality is **the mentor everyone wishes they had**: knowledgeable, experienced, and warm. Expert at their craft but never aloof or condescending. Forward-thinking and realistic. The intersection of professional and personable — never trading substance for showmanship, but knowing when a well-placed wink is worth a thousand words.
---
## The Four Voice Dimensions
### 1. Knowledgeable
Speak with confidence and deep expertise in web design and development. Build trust with a pro audience without being condescending or jargon-heavy.
- ✅ Confidently share expertise in empowering ways
- ✅ Speak the language of a pro audience
- ❌ Be condescending
- ❌ Overdo jargon or sound overly academic
### 2. Empowering
Be uplifting and motivational. Center the **customer**, not Webflow. Believe in what customers can achieve. Be optimistic about technology — never fear-mongering.
- ✅ Uplift and center the customer ("you can..." not "we built this to allow...")
- ✅ Acknowledge the complexity of Webflow honestly
- ❌ Pretend Webflow has no learning curve
- ❌ Be negative about those complexities
### 3. Down-to-earth
Sound like a real, approachable person. Say more with less. Focus on real-world solutions and outcomes. Humor is welcome — but never at the expense of substance.
- ✅ Default to straightforward language
- ✅ Use well-placed humor (PG, positive, never try-hard)
- ✅ Use contractions (you're, it's, we're)
- ❌ Use complicated metaphors or grandiose language
- ❌ Overpromise
- ❌ Trade substance for a cheap laugh
### 4. Bold
Fearlessly embrace tech's power to make the world better — but only when you can back it up. Bold is a bubble over, not a constant boil.
- ✅ Back up bold claims with evidence/specifics
- ✅ Be choosy — bold only when it earns its place
- ❌ Overdo it — boldness should be deliberate

## Voice vs. Tone
**Voice** stays constant — it's always the wise mentor. **Tone** shifts based on:
- **Audience**: Who are they? (marketer, designer, developer, new visitor, power user?)
- **Context**: Where are we talking to them? (ad, blog, support ticket, social?)
- **Content**: What do we need to say?
See `references/tone-by-surface.md` for surface-specific guidance.

## Grammar Quick Rules
1. Use **active voice** wherever possible
2. **Center the customer**: "With this new feature, you can..." NOT "We built this to allow..."
3. **Be concise** — vary sentence length, cut the filler
4. Use **contractions** (you're, it's) for conversational warmth
5. Use **American English**
6. **Sentence case** in headings and body copy (not Title Case, except event names)
7. Spell out numbers **one through ten**; use numerals for 11+
8. Use the **Oxford comma**
9. Limit exclamation points — you get one per piece; use it wisely
10. Spaces before and after em dashes — like this — and ellipses ... like this

## Critical "Don't Say" Rules
| ❌ Don't say | ✅ Say instead |
|---|---|
| "No-code tool" | "Website experience platform" |
| "Easy to use" / "anyone can use Webflow" | Acknowledge the learning curve honestly |
| "Simply" or "just" (when describing steps) | Be direct without minimizing |
| "Accessible" (for the whole product) | Be specific: "more available to more people" |
| "In-house teams (IHTs)" / "Service providers (SPs)" | Marketers, designers, developers, freelancers, agencies |
| "On Webflow" (generally) | "With Webflow" or "in Webflow" depending on context |
| "No code" / "without code" | "Without writing code" |
| Buzzwords | Precise, meaningful language |

## Inclusive Language Essentials
- Default to **gender-neutral pronouns** (they/them) when unverified
- Capitalize **Black**, **Native**, **Indigenous**
- Avoid ableist language: use "unheard of" not "crazy," "details" not "nitty-gritty," "blocklist/allowlist" not "blacklist/whitelist"
- Avoid unnecessarily gendered terms: use "folks/people" not "guys," "humankind" not "mankind"
- Webflow defaults to **identity-first** disability language (e.g., "disabled person") unless someone specifies otherwise
For the full inclusive language reference, see `references/inclusive-language.md`.

## Punctuation Cheat Sheet
- **Oxford comma**: always in lists of 3+
- **Em dash** (—): with spaces on each side, for asides or dramatic pauses
- **En dash** (–): for ranges (12pm–2pm)
- **Ellipsis** (...): space before and after
- **Exclamation point** (!): one per piece, reserved for genuinely exciting things
- **%**: always use the symbol, not "percent"
- **Parentheses**: use sparingly; em dashes often work better
---
## Capitalization
- **Sentence case** everywhere (headings, body, bullets)
- **Title case** only for owned event names (e.g., "Webflow X Agency Snack Hour")
- **Capitalize** these Webflow products: Webflow, CMS, Analyze, Hosting, Ecommerce, Localization, Optimize
- **ALL CAPS**: only for acronyms or H6 headings; use bold/italics for emphasis instead
---
## Emoji
Use sparingly. Best in social, support, and lifecycle channels. Only for positive emotions, only when the sentiment is shared. Example: "I'm glad that helped! 🎉"

## AEO Optimization (Blog Content)
AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) ensures blog content performs well in AI-powered search. Apply these guidelines whenever writing or editing blog posts, articles, or long-form content.
### Write for AI readability
Comprehensive, in-depth, easy-to-read content ranks best in AI search. That means:
- **No fluff** — every sentence should earn its place; cut anything that doesn't add meaning or value
- **Clarity first** — if a sentence could be misread or requires re-reading, rewrite it
- **Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)** — answer the search intent in the opening paragraph; don't bury the lead
- **Plain language** — avoid complexity and "word salads"; if a simpler word works, use it
- **Data in sentences** — back up claims with specific numbers, stats, or evidence (e.g., "Teams using Webflow ship sites 2x faster" not "Teams ship sites faster")
- **Semantic structure** — use headlines and sections that clearly signal what each part is about, so AI can parse and surface them accurately
### Chunk your content
AI search engines pull discrete, self-contained answers from content. Structure every blog post so it can be "chunked" cleanly:
- **One idea per section** — each H2 or H3 covers exactly one subtopic; don't blend concepts
- **Keyword-led headers** — write H2/H3 headers that match how people search (e.g., "How to build a landing page in Webflow" not "Let's get building")
- **Self-contained paragraphs** — any key paragraph should make sense when read in isolation, without requiring surrounding context; if it doesn't, add the missing context
- **Concise sections** — keep sections focused and tight; if a section is sprawling, break it into two
### Quick checklist for blog posts
Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] Search intent is answered in the first paragraph
- [ ] Every H2/H3 contains a relevant keyword and signals the section's topic clearly
- [ ] No section mixes more than one core idea
- [ ] At least one data point or specific stat supports the main claim
- [ ] Key paragraphs pass the "out of context" test — they make sense standalone
- [ ] Filler phrases are cut (e.g., "In today's fast-paced world...", "It goes without saying...")
